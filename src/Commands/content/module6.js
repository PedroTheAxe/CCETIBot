        const learningModuleText = "\nAs it was mentioned in the previous learning module, code-switching is a common practice among all languages, but for the most part ‚Äúcode-mixing has, of course, been limited to spoken discourse‚Äù (Martin, E., 1998). However, especially in non-English native countries, code-switching can be used in advertising as a way of bringing more customers in. Let us take a look at the main reasons why one would use code-switching (specifically English) in advertising.\nAccording to Nerghes (2011), it is a marketing strategy that globalizes brands as ‚Äúhaving a uniform campaign or slogan‚Äù will bring in more foreign customers.\n" 
								 
		const learningModuleTxt2 = "Nerghes (2011) also mentioned that code-mixing is used as a creative way of filling lexical gaps, especially when there are no appropriate words or expressions in the host language to be utilized. Not only that, but it may attract more attention of customers as English buzzwords (which can be viewed as fashionable jargon) used in advertising are short, easy to memorize and fine sounding.\nFinally, and according to Nerghes (2011), English carries certain cultural connotations which are used to reflect positivity on the product and appeal to the consumer. It is believed that the use of English code-switching draws customers in because it is associated with ‚Äúyouth, prestige, modernity, globalization, cosmopolitanism, and internationalism‚Äù (Ustinova & Bhatia, 2005 pg 117)."
